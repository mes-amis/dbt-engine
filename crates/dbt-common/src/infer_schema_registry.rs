//! Cross-model registry for `--infer-schemas`: records, for each relation
//! referenced by the SQL being bound, which columns were confidently
//! inferred from usage. Shared across every model bound in a run.
//!
//! Writers populate the registry during binding. Once binding finishes,
//! consumers only read it; later analysis must not add inferred columns.
//!
//! Plan-tree-based column lineage (`dbt-lineage`) can't see these columns on
//! its own: an inferred column becomes an opaque placeholder in the bound
//! plan, with no real column reference left to trace back to its source.
//! This registry is the only place that still has that information,
//! captured at the moment inference happens. Lineage computation reads it
//! back (keyed by the relation name recorded as metadata on the
//! placeholder) to fill placeholders back in before walking the plan.
