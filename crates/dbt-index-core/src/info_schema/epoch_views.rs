//! Generator for the information schema as views straight over `target/private/metadata/`,
//! with no materialization step.
//!
//! The SQL it produces declares the same schema names, table names, column names
//! and column order as `views.sql` — the difference is only where the rows come
//! from. `views.sql` reads the parquet snapshot beside it; this reads the epoch
//! files live, so a query sees the state of the last invocation without a
//! conversion having run. The differential test in `tests_epoch.rs` keeps that
//! substitution honest.
//!
//! It is *not* written into the shipped info-schema directory: it reads the
//! private `target/private/metadata/` layout through the `dbt_internal` epoch relations,
//! which are not part of the public contract (see `write_info_schema`). The
//! generator exists for that differential test and for a future serve path that
//! queries metadata live; a caller runs [`generate`] and executes or writes the
//! statements itself.
//!
//! Paths are absolute: DuckDB resolves globs against the process CWD, and the
//! metadata directory is relocatable via `DBT_METADATA_DIR`, so this cannot be a
//! static asset shipped with the binary.
//!
//! Tables whose staging columns are not fully mapped in [`super::epoch`] are
//! *skipped* rather than half-emitted. A partially mapped table would publish
//! silently-null columns, which is the exact failure the mapping exists to
//! prevent; skipping keeps the file's contract "every view here is equivalent to
//! its `views.sql` counterpart".
