//! SQL equivalents for the staging columns the information schema is built from.
//!
//! [`super::schema::INFO_SCHEMA`] declares each output column as a *staging*
//! column — the shape the Rust ingest produces in the staging directory (the
//! flat index at `target/private/index/`, or a private fallback). A view layer over the
//! epoch files has no staging directory, so every referenced staging column needs
//! an expression
//! over the epoch parquet instead. This module is that mapping, declared once in
//! the same style as `spec.rs` rather than written inline in generated SQL: the
//! ~200 JSON extractions are each a fact currently encoded in a Rust row builder
//! in `ingest/metadata_to_parquet.rs`, and re-stating them is 200 chances to
//! pick a key that silently yields an all-null column.
//!
//! Two tests hold the mapping closed. [`tests::every_referenced_column_is_mapped`]
//! walks `INFO_SCHEMA` and fails on a pair with no entry, so a new output column
//! cannot be added without stating where the view layer gets it. The
//! differential test in `tests_epoch.rs` compares the two paths column by column
//! on a real project, so a *wrong* entry fails too.
